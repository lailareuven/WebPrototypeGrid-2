<h3>Our mission is to brighten the lives of seriously ill children and their families!</h3>
   <p> We believe our main purpose at Starlight is to bring happiness to children facing the negative impacts of their serious illness. Childhood should be a fun and joyful part of life and everyone should get to experience this. Evoking happiness in these children is so important to us as it masks their pain from illness and treatment as well as reduces the fear and stress that comes with this. </p>

   <p>"Being seriously ill shouldn't mean missing out on the fun of childhood, especially when evidence shows happiness helps kids bounce back after going through tough times" - Louise Baxter, Starlight CEO

</ul>

<p> <strong>Wishgranting</strong> makes dreams come true by promising a once-in-a-lifetime experience personally curated to fit each child’s wish. It also provides them a fun break from the hospital doing something they have always wanted to experience. This initiative gives these children something to plan and anticipate in order to take their mind off everything else.  </p>

<p> In the <strong>Starlight Express Rooms</strong> no medical talk is allowed and Captain Starlight ensures kids don’t stop laughing the whole time they are there. In there are lots of enjoyable activities such as Xbox, face painting, magic shows and many more.</p>

<p>
  Delivered both in hospital and online, <strong>Livewire</strong> is for young people aged 12-20 who suffer from serious illness, disability or chronic health condition. This incredible program focuses on teaching management for the stress, anxiety and isolation of hospital and serious illness by connecting sick teenagers with others their age so together they can help one another through their illness.
