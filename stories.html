  <p> A seemingly healthy baby, Nora woke from a nap one afternoon and couldn’t move her legs.
Within days doctors discovered a fist-size tumour in her chest, crushing her spinal
cord. At just eight months old, she was fighting for her life, diagnosed with a rare
early childhood cancer called neuroblastoma. </p>

<p> For Nora's mum, Naomi, the grief was unimaginable. “At the moment of diagnosis, our life as we knew it and the future we had planned flashed before us – and everything became uncertain,” she says. </p>


<p>Nora started treatment straight away and hospital became the family’s second home. Amid all the pain, Naomi saw their little girl's spirit shine through. "She's a fighter,” says Naomi. “She had to be to get through six months of chemotherapy and surgery and never-ending tests, scans and needles."</p>

<p>Naomi was caring for Nora 24/7, spending a lot of time at hospital, while dad Hannes reduced his working hours. It was a struggle as the family felt torn in half. "Financially, emotionally and mentally, everything changed," Naomi says.</p>

<p>It was also hard on Nora's two brothers, Jonte and Johnas, who were only aged 4 and 6 at the time. The family had to limit outings and activities as Nora's immune system was so weak from chemotherapy. Even the simple task of grocery shopping was too high a risk and the boys would stay with their grandparents if they got sick, to keep Nora safe.</p>

<p>The one bright light during Nora's long and gruelling time in hospital was discovering Captain Starlight and the Starlight Express Room. Nora spent half a year at the Princess Margaret Hospital (now Perth Children's Hospital), and Naomi says Starlight helped the whole family cope with the pain and sadness of Nora's illness and treatment.</p>

<p>“The boys always wanted to go to the Starlight Express Room whenever they came to the hospital,” says Naomi. “It gave my husband, Hannes, time with Nora and I could spend some much-needed fun time with Jonte and Johnas. I felt like I missed so much of their lives that year.”</p>

<p>The family did everything they could to stay upbeat, and Starlight helped bring joy and happiness amid all their pain. Nora's eyes lit up whenever a Captain Starlight visited the ward, bringing laughter and balloon animals, and it broke up the long days when she was confined to her hospital room. "The Captain Starlights are so friendly and positive, they keep the fun alive,” says Naomi.</p>

<p>Thankfully Nora has finished treatment for now, but regular hospital check-ups continue. Most visits involve a trip to the Starlight Express Room and having fun with Captain Starlight gives Nora something to look forward to after every appointment. Outside of hospital, Naomi says it is wonderful to see her daughter so happy, doing the 'normal' kid stuff she missed out on like ballet, swimming in the ocean and jumping in the pool.</p>

<p>Recently Nora was given the incredible gift of hope and happiness, being granted her Starlight Wish. She was over the moon with excitement.</p>

<p>As Nora loves camping with her family, she chose a camper trailer for her Starlight Wish, to enjoy precious time together with her family, away from hospital. "Nora's wish will help us create memories for years to come," Naomi says.</p>

<p>And, no matter what future medical hurdles she may face, Nora will have the lasting treasure of her Starlight Wish.</p>

<p>To Starlight supporters, Naomi says: “Thank you for everything you have done for Nora and our family. Your support helped us make this unbearable journey a much more positive one filled with happy memories.”</p>
